    "###### Python lists such as those returned by the string's split method are sequences of objects. Unlike strings, lists are mutable in so far as the elements within them can be replaced or removed, and new elements can be inserted or appended. Lists are the workhorse of Python data structures. Literal lists are delimited by square brackets, and the items within the list separated by commas. Here is a list of three numbers and a list of three strings. We can retrieve elements by using square brackets with a zero-based index, and we can replace elements by assigning to a specific element. See how lists can be heterogeneous with respect to the types of the objects. We now have a list containing a string, an integer, and another string. It's often useful to create an empty list, which we can do using empty square brackets. We can modify the list in other ways. Let's add some floats to the end of the list using the append method. There are many other useful methods for manipulating lists, which we'll cover in a later module. There is also a list constructor, which can be used to create lists from other collections such as strings. Finally, although the significant whitespace rules in Python can at first seem very rigid, there is a lot of flexibility. For example, if at the end of the line brackets, braces, or parentheses are unclosed, you can continue on the next line. This can be very useful for long literal collections or simply to improve readability. See also how we're allowed to use an additional comma after the last element, an important maintainability feature.\n",

    "# Shallow Copies\n",
    "###### To demonstrate this, we'll used nested lists with the inner list serving as mutable objects. Here's a list containing two elements, each of which is itself a list. Let's look at what's going on under the covers as Python constructs this data structure. First, two integer objects are created containing the values 1 and 2 respectively. The elements of the first inner list are references to these two integer objects. Now two more integer objects are created containing the values 3 and 4 respectively. The elements of the second inner list are references to these integer objects. Now the outer list is created, its elements containing references to the two inner lists. Finally, the reference named A is bound to the outer list. What happens when we copy the list? Here we use the full slice technique, but any of the three techniques we've shown will have the same effect. We're requesting a copy of outer list, so it's elements, which contain references to the two inner lists, are duplicated. These references refer to the same inner lists as the original list A. Once the list copy is complete, we bind a new reference named B to the new list. We can confirm that the lists are distinct objects by testing with A is B, which returns False. They do, however, contain equivalent values, which we can test with A == B, which returns True. Not only are the elements at a(0) and b(0) equivalent, they actually refer to the same inner list object. Now let's replace the element at a(0) with a new list containing 8 and 9. This results in the construction of two new integer objects containing 8 and 9 respectively and the new list, the elements of which are references to these two new integer objects. The reference in a(0) is redirected to point to this new inner list object, and we can confirm that a(0) now indeed points to the new list while b(0) is unmodified. What happens if we now append to the inner list referred to by a(1)? Let's append a new integer object containing the value 5. The new integer object is created and is referred to by an additional element in the inner list referred to by a(1), so a(1) now refers to a list containing integers 3, 4, 5. Significantly, because a(1) and b(1) refer to the same inner list, the list accessible through b(1) has also been modified. Following these manipulations, the data structure referred to by A is a list containing two elements, each of which itself is a list. The first inner list contains 8 and 9, and the second inner list contains 3, 4, and 5. The data structure referred to by B is also a list containing two inner lists. The first element refers to a list containing 1 and 2, and the second element also refers to the 3, 4, 5 list."

    "# List Repetition\n",
    "###### As for strings and tuples, lists support repetition using the multiplication operator. It's simple enough to use. Here we repeat a list containing the integers 21 and 37 four times. This form is rarely spotted in the wild. It's most often used for initializing a list of size known in advance to a constant value such as 0. Here we create a list initialized with nine 0 elements. Be aware though that in the case of mutable elements the same trap for the unwary that occurred with list copying lurks here since repetition will repeat the reference without copying the value. Let's demonstrate using nested lists as our mutable elements again. We'll repeat a list five times. The mutable element it contains will be another list containing elements, two -1 and +1. Let's see what Python needs to do to construct this data structure. First, two integer objects are created containing the values -1 and +1 respectively. These are referred to by the two elements of the inner list. Python then creates the outer list and the ranges for its single element to contain a reference to the inner list. Now the repetition operation is applied. A new list is created containing five elements, each of which contains a copy of the single element in the original outer list. All of these elements contain references to the same inner list object. Now the temporary single element outer list can be disposed of. Finally, this whole data structure is bound to a new named reference, S. As expected, S contains five elements, each of which is the -1, +1 in a list. Now let's append the integer 7 to the fourth inner list at index 3 in the outer list. This creates a new integer object and a new element on the inner list containing a reference to that integer object. We can see that all of the elements of the outer list have been modified because they do in fact all refer to the same inner list."
