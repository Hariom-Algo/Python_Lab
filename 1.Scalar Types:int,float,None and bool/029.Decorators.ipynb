We'll also look at the related concept of closures, which are key to really understanding local functions, and we'll close off the module with a look at Python's function decorators. As you'll recall, in Python the def keyword is used to define new functions. Def essentially binds the body of a function to a name in such a way that functions are simply objects like everything else in Python. It's important to remember that def is executed at runtime meaning that functions are defined at runtime. Up to now almost all of the functions we have looked at have been defined at module scope or inside classes in which case we refer to them as methods. However, Python doesn't restrict you to just defining functions in those two contexts. In fact, Python allows you to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are often referred to as local functions since they're defined local to a specific function's scope. Let's see a quick example. "

The function object outer has no attribute named inner. Inner is only defined when outer is executed, and even then it's just a normal variable in the execution of the function's body. So, what are local functions useful for? As we've seen, they're useful for things like creating sorting key functions. It makes sense to define these close to the call site if they're one-off specialized functions, so local functions are a code organization in readability aid. In this way they're similar to lambdas, which as you'll recall are simple, unnamed function objects. Local functions are more general than lambdas though since they may contain multiple expressions and may contain statements such as import. Local functions are also useful for other more interesting purposes, but before we can look at those we'll need to investigate two more concepts, returning functions from functions and closures."

They're not somehow specially bound to the enclosing function and so forth. Like other bindings in a function, local functions can also be returned from functions. Returning a local function does not look any different than returning any other object. Let's see an example. Here enclosing defines local_func and returns it. Callers of enclosing combined its returned value to a name, in this case lf, and then call it like any other function. This ability to return functions is part of the broader notion of first-class functions where functions can be passed to and returned from other functions or more generally treated like any other piece of data. This concept can be very powerful, particularly when combined with closures, which we'll explore in the next section."

    "# Closures and Nested Scopes\n",
    "##### So far the local functions we've looked at have all been fairly boring. They're defined within another function scope, but they don't really interact with the enclosing scope; however, we did see that local functions can reference bindings in their enclosing scope via the LEGB rule. Furthermore, we saw that local functions can be returned from their defining scope and executed in another scope. This raises an interesting question. How does a local function use bindings to objects defined in a scope that no longer exists? That is once a local function is returned from its enclosing scope, that enclosing scope is gone along with any local objects it defined. How can the local function operate without that enclosing scope? The answer is that the local function forms what is known as a closure. A closure essentially remembers the objects from the enclosing scope that the local function needs. It then keeps them alive so that when the local function is executed they can still be used. One way to think of this is that the local function closes over the objects it needs preventing them from being garbage collected. Python implements closures with a special attribute named dunder-closure. If a function closes over any objects, the net function has a dunder-closure attribute, which maintains the necessary references to those objects. We can see that in a simple example. The dunder-closure attribute of lf indicates that lf is a closure, and we can see that the closure is referring to a single object. In this case, that object is the X variable defined in the function that defined lf. So, we can see that local functions can safely use objects from an inner enclosing scope, but how is this really useful?"

    "# Function Factories\n",
    "###### A very common use for closures is in so-called function factories. These factories are functions that return other functions where the returned functions are specialized in some way based on arguments to the factory. In other words, the factory function takes some arguments. It then creates a local function, which takes its own arguments, but also uses the arguments passed to the factory. The combination of runtime function definition enclosures makes this possible. A typical example of this kind of factory creates a function, which raises numbers to a particular power. Here's how the factory looks. Raise_to takes a single argument, exp, which is an exponent. It returns a function that raises its arguments to that exponent. You can see that the local function raise_to_exp refers to exp in its implementation, and this means that Python will create a closure to refer to that object. If we call raise_to, we can verify that it creates this closure. We can also see that square does indeed behave as we expect, and we can create other functions the same way. "

    "# The Nonlocal Keyword\n",
    "###### The use of local functions raises some interesting questions regarding name lookup. We've looked in some detail at the LEGB rule, which determines how names are resolved in Python when we want the values to which those name refer. However, LEGB doesn't apply when we're making new name bindings. Consider this simple example. When we assign to message in the function local, what precisely is happening? In this case we're creating a new name binding in that function's scope for the name message to the string local. Critically we are not rebinding either of the other message variables in the code. We can see this by instrumenting the code a bit. Now we're actually calling the function's enclosing and local. Again, local is creating an entirely new name binding, which only applies in the context of that function. If we run this code, we'll see that neither the global nor enclosing bindings for message are affected by calling local. In earlier courses we discussed Python's global keyword. Global can be used to introduce a binding from the global scope into another scope. So, in our example if we wanted the function local to modify the global binding for message rather than creating a new one, we could use the global keyword to introduce the global message binding into local. Let's do that and see the effects. "

    "###### First let's use the global keyword to introduce the module level binding of message into the function local. If we run this, we can see that the module level binding of message is indeed changed when local is called. Again, the global keyword should be familiar to you already. If it's not, you can always review Module 4 of the Python Fundamentals course. If global allows you to insert module-level name bindings into a function in Python, how can you do the same for name bindings in enclosing scopes? Or in terms of our example, how can we make the function local modify the binding for message defined in the function enclosing? The answer to that is that Python also provides the keyword nonlocal. Nonlocal inserts a name binding from an enclosing namespace into the local namespace. More precisely, nonlocal searches the enclosing namespace from innermost to outermost for the name you give it. As soon as it finds a match, that binding is introduced into the scope where nonlocal was invoked. Let's modify our example again to show how the function local can be made to modify the binding of message created in the function enclosing by using nonlocal. Now when we run this code we see that local is indeed changing the binding in enclosing. It's important to remember that it's an error to use nonlocal when there's no matching enclosing binding. If you do this, Python will raise a SyntaxError. You can see this if you add a call to nonlocal in our function local, which refers to a nonexistent name. When you try to execute this code, Python will complain that no such name does not exist. Like global, nonlocal is not something you're likely to need to use a lot, but it's important to understand how to use it for those times when it's really necessary or for when you see it used in other people's code. To really drive it home, let's create a more practical example that uses nonlocal. In this example, the make_timer function returns a new function. Each time you call this new function it returns the elapsed time since the last time you called it. Here's how it looks. (Typing) And here's how you can use it. (Typing) As you can see, the first time you invoke T it returns nothing. After that it returns the amount of time since the last invocation. How does this work? Every time you call make_timer it creates a new local variable named last_called. It then defines a local function called elapsed, which uses the nonlocal keyword to insert make_timer's binding of last_called into its local scope. Elapsed then uses the last_called binding to keep track of the last time it was called. In other words, elapsed uses nonlocal to refer to a name binding, which will exist across multiple calls to elapsed. In this way elapsed is using nonlocal to create a form of persistent storage. It's worth noting that each call to make_timer creates a new independent binding of last_called, as well as a new definition of elapsed. This means that each call to make_timer creates a new independent timer object, which you can verify by creating multiple timers. As you can see, calls to T1 have no affect on T2, and they are both keeping independent times.\n",

    "# Function Decorators\n",
    "##### Now that we've looked at the concepts of local functions and closures, we have what we need to finally look at an interesting and useful Python feature called the decorators. At a high level decorators are a way to modify or enhance existing functions in a nonintrusive and maintainable way. In Python a decorator is a callable object that takes in a callable and returns a callable. If that sounds a bit abstract, it might be simpler for now to think of decorators as functions that take a function as an argument and return another function, but the concept is a bit more general than that as we'll see. Coupled with this definition is a special syntax that lets you decorate functions with decorators. The syntax looks like this. This example applies the decorator, in this case named @my_decorator, to the function named in this case my_function(). The at symbol is a special syntax for applying decorators to functions. So, what does this actually do? When Python sees decorator application like this, it first compiles the base function, which in this case is my_function. As always, this produces a new function object. Python then passes this function object to the function my_decorator. Remember that decorators by definition take callable objects as their only argument, and they're required to return a callable object as well. After calling the decorator with the original function object, Python takes the return value from the decorator and binds it to the name of the original function. The end result is that the name my_function is bound to the result of calling my_decorator with the function created by the def my_function line. In other words, decorators allow you to replace, enhance, or modify existing functions without changing those functions. Callers of the original function don't have to change their code because the decorator mechanism ensures that the same name is used for both the decorated and undecorated function."
